<section id="1">
Bartram the lime-burner, a rough, heavy-looking man, begrimed with charcoal, sat watching his
kiln at nightfall, while his little son played at building houses with the scattered fragments of
marble, when, on the hillside below them, they heard a roar of laughter, not mirthful, but slow,
and even solemn, like a wind shaking the boughs of the forest.
</section>
<section id="2">
“Father, what is that?” asked the little boy, leaving his play, and pressing betwixt his father’s knees.
</section>
<section id="3">
“O, some drunken man, I suppose,” answered the lime-burner; “some merry fellow from the barroom in the village, who dared not laugh loud enough within doors lest he should blow the roof of
the house off. So here he [113] is, shaking his jolly sides at the foot of Graylock.”
</section>
<section id="4">
“But, father,” said the child, more sensitive than the obtuse, middle-aged clown, “he does not
laugh like a man that is glad. So the noise frightens me!”
</section>
<section id="5">
“Don’t be a fool, child!” cried his father gruffly. “You will never make a man, I do believe; there is
too much of your mother in you. I have known the rustling of a leaf startle you. Hark! Here comes
the merry fellow now. You shall see that there is no harm in him.”
</section>
<section id="6">
Bartram and his little son, while they were talking thus, sat watching the same lime-kiln that had
been the scene of Ethan Brand’s solitary and meditative life, before he began his search for the
Unpardonable Sin. Many years, as we have seen, had now elapsed, since that portentous night
when the idea was first developed. The kiln, however, on the mountain-side, stood unimpaired,
and was in nothing changed since he had thrown his dark thoughts into the intense glow of its
furnace, and melted them, as it were, into the one thought that took possession of his life. It was a
rude, round, tower-like structure about twenty feet high, heavily built of rough stones, and with a
hillock of earth heaped about the larger part of its circumference; so that the blocks and fragments
of marble [114] might be drawn by cartloads, and thrown in at the top. There was an opening at
the bottom of the tower, like an oven mouth, but large enough to admit a man in a stooping
posture, and provided with a massive iron door. With the smoke and jets of flame issuing from the
chinks and crevices of this door, which seemed to give admittance into the hillside, it resembled
nothing so much as the private entrance to the infernal regions, which the shepherds of the
Delectable Mountains were accustomed to show to pilgrims.
</section>
<section id="7">
There are many such lime-kilns in that tract of country, for the purpose of burning the white
marble which composes a large part of the substance of the hills. Some of them, built years ago,
and long deserted, with weeds growing in the vacant round of the interior, which is open to the
sky, and grass and wild flowers rooting themselves into the chinks of the stones, look already like
relics of antiquity, and may yet be overspread with the lichens of centuries to come. Others, where
the lime-burner still feeds his daily and night-long fire, afford points of interest to the wanderer
among the hills, who seats himself on a log of wood or a fragment of marble, to hold a chat with
the solitary man. It is a lonesome, and, when the character is inclined to thought, may be an
intensely thoughtful occupation; as it proved in the case of Ethan Brand, who had mused to
such strange purpose, in days gone by, while the fire in this very kiln was burning.
</section>
<section id="8">
The man who now watched the fire was of a different order, and troubled himself with no
thoughts save the very few that were requisite to his business. At frequent intervals, he flung back
the clashing weight of the iron door, and, turning his face from the insufferable glare, thrust in
huge logs of oak, or stirred the immense brands with a long pole. Within the furnace were seen the
curling and riotous flames, and the burning marble, almost molten with the intensity of heat; while
without, the reflection of the fire quivered on the dark intricacy of the surrounding forest, and
showed in the foreground a bright and ruddy little picture of the hut, the spring beside its door, the
athletic and coal-begrimed figure of the lime-burner, and the half-frightened child, shrinking into
the protection of his father’s shadow. And when, again, the iron door was closed, then reappeared
the tender light of the half-full moon, which vainly strove to trace out the indistinct shapes of the
neighboring mountains; and, in the upper sky, there was a flitting congregation of clouds, still
faintly tinged with the rosy sunset, though thus far down into the valley the sunshine had vanished
long and long ago.
</section>
<section id="9">
The little boy now crept still closer to his father, as footsteps were heard ascending the
hillside, and a human form thrust aside the bushes that clustered beneath the trees.
</section>
<section id="10">
“Haloo! who is it?” cried the lime-burner, vexed at his son’s timidity, yet half infected by it. “Come
forward and show yourself, like a man, or I’ll fling this chunk of marble at your head!”
</section>
<section id="11">
“You offer me a rough welcome,” said a gloomy voice, as the unknown man drew nigh. “Yet I
neither claim nor desire a kinder one, even at my own fireside.”
</section>
<section id="12">
To obtain a distincter view, Bartram threw open the iron door of the kiln, whence immediately
issued a gush of fierce light, that smote full upon the stranger’s face and figure. To a careless eye
there appeared nothing very remarkable in his aspect, which was that of a man in a coarse, brown,
country-made suit of clothes, tall and thin, with the staff and heavy shoes of a wayfarer. As he
advanced, he fixed his eyes—which were very bright—intently upon the brightness of the furnace,
as if he beheld, or expected to behold, some object worthy of note within it.
</section>
<section id="13">
“Good-evening, stranger,” said the lime-burner; “whence come you, so late in the day?”
</section>
<section id="14">
“I come from my search,” answered the wayfarer; “for, at last, it is finished.”
</section>
<section id="15">
“Drunk!—or crazy!” muttered Bartram to himself. “I shall have trouble with the fellow. The
sooner I drive him away, the better.”
</section>
<section id="16">
The little boy, all in a tremble, whispered to his father, and begged him to shut the door of the
kiln, so that there might not be so much light; for that there was something in the man’s face which
he was afraid to look at, yet could not look away from. And, indeed, even the lime-burner’s dull
and torpid sense began to be impressed by an indescribable something in that thin, rugged,
thoughtful visage, with the grizzled hair hanging wildly about it, and those deeply sunken eyes,
which gleamed like fires within the entrance of a mysterious cavern. But, as he closed the door, the
stranger turned towards him, and spoke in a quiet, familiar way, that made Bartram feel as if he
were a sane and sensible man, after all.
</section>
<section id="17">
“Your task draws to an end, I see,” said he. “This marble has already been burning three days. A
few more hours will convert the stone to lime.”
</section>
<section id="18">
“Why, who are you?” exclaimed the lime-burner. “You seem as well acquainted with my business
as I am myself.”
</section>
<section id="19">
“And well I may be,” said the stranger; “for I followed the same craft many a long year, and here,
too, on this very spot. But [118] you are a new-comer in these parts. Did you never hear of Ethan
Brand?”
</section>
<section id="20">
“The man that went in search of the Unpardonable Sin?” asked Bartram with a laugh.
</section>
<section id="21">
“The same,” answered the stranger. “He has found what he sought, and therefore he comes back
again.”
</section>
<section id="22">
“What! then you are Ethan Brand himself?” cried the lime-burner in amazement.” I am a newcomer here, as you say, and they call it eighteen years since you left the foot of Graylock. But, I
can tell you, the good folks still talk about Ethan Brand, in the village yonder, and what a strange
errand took him away from his lime-kiln. Well, and so you have found the Unpardonable Sin?”
</section>
<section id="23">
“Even so!” said the stranger calmly
</section>
<section id="24">
“If the question is a fair one,” proceeded Bartram, “where might it be?”
</section>
<section id="25">
Ethan Brand laid his finger on his own heart
</section>
<section id="26">
“Here!” replied he.
</section>
<section id="27">
And then, without mirth in his countenance, but as if moved by an involuntary recognition of the
infinite absurdity of seeking throughout the world for what was the closest of all things to himself,
and looking into every heart, save his own, for what was hidden in no other breast, he broke into a
laugh of scorn. It was the same slow, heavy laugh, that had almost appalled [119] the lime-burner
when it heralded the wayfarer’s approach.
</section>
<section id="28">
The solitary mountain-side was made dismal by it. Laughter, when out of place, mistimed, or
bursting forth from a disordered state of feeling, may be the most terrible modulation of the
human voice. The laughter of one asleep, even if it be a little child,—the madman’s laugh,—the
wild, screaming laugh of a born idiot,—are sounds that we sometimes tremble to hear, and would
always willingly forget. Poets have imagined no utterance of fiends or hobgoblins so fearfully
appropriate as a laugh. And even the obtuse lime-burner felt his nerves shaken, as this strange man
looked inward at his own heart, and burst into laughter that rolled away into the night, and was
indistinctly reverberated among the hills.
“Joe,” said he to his little son, “scamper down to the tavern in the village, and tell the jolly fellows
there that Ethan Brand has come back, and that he has found the Unpardonable Sin!”
</section>
<section id="29">
The boy darted away on his errand, to which Ethan Brand made no objection, nor seemed hardly
to notice it. He sat on a log of wood, looking steadfastly at the iron door of the kiln. When the child
was out of sight, and his swift and light footsteps ceased to be heard treading first on the fallen
leaves and then on the rocky [120] mountain-path, the lime-burner began to regret his departure.
He felt that the little fellow’s presence had been a barrier between his guest and himself, and that
he must now deal, heart to heart, with a man who, on his own confession, had committed the one
only crime for which Heaven could afford no mercy. That crime, in its indistinct blackness,
seemed to overshadow him. The lime-burner’s own sins rose up within him, and made his memory
riotous with a throng of evil shapes that asserted their kindred with the Master Sin, whatever it
might be, which it was within the scope of man’s corrupted nature to conceive and cherish. They
were all of one family; they went to and fro between his breast and Ethan Brand’s, and carried
dark greetings from one to the other
</section>
<section id="30">
Then Bartram remembered the stories which had grown traditionary in reference to this strange
man, who had come upon him like a shadow of the night, and was making himself at home in his
old place, after so long absence, that the dead people, dead and buried for years, would have had
more right to be at home, in any familiar spot, than he. Ethan Brand, it was said, had conversed
with Satan himself in the lurid blaze of this very kiln. The legend had been matter of mirth
heretofore, but looked grisly now. According to this tale, before Ethan Brand departed on his
search, he had been accustomed [121] to evoke a fiend from the hot furnace of the lime-kiln, night
after night, in order to confer with him about the Unpardonable Sin; the man and the fiend each
laboring to frame the image of some mode of guilt which could neither be atoned for nor forgiven.
And, with the first gleam of light upon the mountain-top, the fiend crept in at the iron door, there
to abide the intensest element of fire until again summoned forth to share in the dreadful task of
extending man’s possible guilt beyond the scope of Heaven’s else infinite mercy.
</section>
<section id="31">
While the lime-burner was struggling with the horror of these thoughts, Ethan Brand rose from the
log, and flung open the door of the kiln. The action was in such accordance with the idea in
Bartram’s mind, that he almost expected to see the Evil One issue forth, red-hot, from the raging
furnace.
</section>
<section id="32">
“Hold! hold!” cried he, with a tremulous attempt to laugh; for he was ashamed of his fears,
although they overmastered him. “Don’t, for mercy’s sake, bring out your Devil now!”
</section>
<section id="33">
“Man!” sternly replied Ethan Brand, “what need have I of the Devil? I have left him behind me,
on my track. It is with such halfway sinners as you that he busies himself. Fear not, because I open
the door. I do but act by old custom, and am going to trim your fire like a lime-burner, as I was
once.”
</section>
<section id="34">
He stirred the vast coals, thrust in more wood, and bent forward to gaze into the hollow prison
house of the fire, regardless of the fierce glow that reddened upon his face. The lime-burner sat
watching him, and half suspected this strange guest of a purpose, if not to evoke a fiend, at least to
plunge bodily into the flames, and thus vanish from the sight of man. Ethan Brand, however, drew
quietly back, and closed the door of the kiln.
</section>
<section id="35">
“I have looked,” said he, “into many a human heart that was seven times hotter with sinful
passions than yonder furnace is with fire. But I found not there what I sought. No, not the
Unpardonable Sin!”
</section>
<section id="36">
“What is the Unpardonable Sin?” asked the lime-burner; and then he shrank farther from his
companion, trembling lest his question should be answered.
</section>
<section id="37">
It is a sin that grew within my own breast,” replied Ethan Brand, standing erect, with a pride that
distinguishes all enthusiasts of his stamp. “A sin that grew nowhere else! The sin of an intellect that
triumphed over the sense of brotherhood with man and reverence for God, and sacrificed
everything to its own mighty claims! The only sin that deserves a recompense of immortal agony!
Freely, were it to do again, would I incur the guilt. Unshrinkingly I accept the retribution!”
</section>
<section id="38">
“The man’s head is turned,” muttered the lime-burner to himself. “He may be a sinner like the
rest of us,—nothing more likely,—but, I’ll be sworn, he is a madman too.”
</section>
<section id="39">
Nevertheless, he felt uncomfortable at his situation, alone with Ethan Brand on the wild mountainside, and was right glad to hear the rough murmur of tongues, and the footsteps of what seemed a
pretty numerous party, stumbling over the stones and rustling through the underbrush. Soon
appeared the whole lazy regiment that was wont to infest the village tavern, comprehending three
or four individuals who had drunk flip beside the bar-room fire through all the winters, and
smoked their pipes beneath the stoop through all the summers, since Ethan Brand’s departure.
Laughing boisterously and mingling all their voices together in unceremonious talk, they now burst
into the moonshine and narrow streaks of firelight that illuminated the open space before the limekiln. Bartram set the door ajar again, flooding the spot with light, that the whole company might
get a fair view of Ethan Brand, and he of them.
</section>
<section id="40">
There, among other old acquaintances, was a once ubiquitous man, now almost extinct, but whom
we were formerly sure to encounter at the hotel of every thriving village throughout the country. It
was the stage agent. The present specimen of the genus was a wilted and [124] smoke-dried man,
wrinkled and red-nosed, in a smartly cut, brown, bobtailed coat, with brass buttons, who, for a
length of time unknown, had kept his desk and corner in the bar-room, and was still puffing what
seemed to be the same cigar that he had lighted twenty years before. He had great fame as a dry
joker, though, perhaps, less on account of any intrinsic humor than from a certain flavor of brandy
toddy and tobacco smoke, which impregnated all his ideas and expressions, as well as his person.
Another well-remembered, though strangely altered, face was that of Lawyer Giles, as people still
called him in courtesy; an elderly ragamuffin, in his soiled shirtsleeves and tow-cloth trousers. This
poor fellow had been an attorney, in what he called his better days, a sharp practitioner, and in
great vogue among the village litigants; but flip, and sling, and toddy, and cocktails, imbibed at all
hours, morning, noon, and night, had caused him to slide from intellectual to various kinds and
degrees of bodily labor, till at last, to adopt his own phrase, he slid into a soap-vat. In other words,
Giles was now a soap-boiler, in a small way. He had come to be but the fragment of a human
being, a part of one foot having been chopped off by an axe, and an entire hand torn away by the
devilish grip of a steam-engine. Yet, though the corporeal hand was gone, a spiritual member
remained; for [125] stretching forth the stump, Giles steadfastly averred that he felt an invisible
thumb and fingers with as vivid a sensation as before the real ones were amputated. A maimed
and miserable wretch he was; but one, nevertheless, whom the world could not trample on, and
had no right to scorn, either in this or any previous stage of his misfortunes, since he had still kept
up the courage and spirit of a man, asked nothing in charity, and with his one hand—and that the
left one—fought a stern battle against want and hostile circumstances.
</section>
<section id="41">
Among the throng, too, came another personage, who, with certain points of similarity to Lawyer
Giles, had many more of difference. It was the village doctor; a man of some fifty years, whom, at
an earlier period of his life, we introduced as paying a professional visit to Ethan Brand during the
latter’s supposed insanity. He was now a purple-visaged, rude, and brutal, yet half-gentlemanly
figure, with something wild, ruined, and desperate in his talk, and in all the details of his gesture
and manners. Brandy possessed this man like an evil spirit, and made him as surly and savage as a
wild beast, and as miserable as a lost soul; but there was supposed to be in him such wonderful
skill, such native gifts of healing, beyond any which medical science could impart, that society
caught hold of him, and would not let him sink out [126] of its reach. So, swaying to and fro upon
his horse, and grumbling thick accents at the bedside, he visited all the sick-chambers for miles
about among the mountain towns, and sometimes raised a dying man, as it were, by miracle, or
quite as often, no doubt, sent his patient to a grave that was dug many a year too soon. The doctor
had an everlasting pipe in his mouth, and, as somebody said, in allusion to his habit of swearing, it
was always alight with hell-fire
</section>
<section id="42">
These three worthies pressed forward, and greeted Ethan Brand each after his own fashion,
earnestly inviting him to partake of the contents of a certain black bottle, in which, as they averred,
he would find something far better worth seeking for than the Unpardonable Sin. No mind, which
has wrought itself by intense and solitary meditation into a high state of enthusiasm, can endure
the kind of contact with low and vulgar modes of thought and feeling to which Ethan Brand was
now subjected. It made him doubt—and, strange to say, it was a painful doubt—whether he had
indeed found the Unpardonable Sin, and found it within himself. The whole question on which he
had exhausted life, and more than life, looked like a delusion.
</section>
<section id="43">
“Leave me,” he said bitterly, “ye brute beasts, that have made yourselves so, shrivelling up your
souls with fiery liquors! I have done [127] with you. Years and years ago, I groped into your hearts
and found nothing there for my purpose. Get ye gone!”
</section>
<section id="44">
“Why, you uncivil scoundrel,” cried the fierce doctor, “is that the way you respond to the kindness
of your best friends? Then let me tell you the truth. You have no more found the Unpardonable
Sin than yonder boy Joe has. You are but a crazy fellow,—I told you so twenty years ago,—
neither better nor worse than a crazy fellow, and the fit companion of old Humphrey, here!”
</section>
<section id="45">
He pointed to an old man, shabbily dressed, with long white hair, thin visage, and unsteady eyes.
For some years past this aged person had been wandering about among the hills, inquiring of all
travellers whom he met for his daughter. The girl, it seemed, had gone off with a company of
circus performers, and occasionally tidings of her came to the village, and fine stories were told of
her glittering appearance as she rode on horseback in the ring, or performed marvellous feats on
the tight-rope.
</section>
<section id="46">
The white-haired father now approached Ethan Brand, and gazed unsteadily into his face.
</section>
<section id="47">
“They tell me you have been all over the earth,” said he, wringing his hands with earnestness.
“You must have seen my daughter, for she makes a grand figure in the world, and [128]
everybody goes to see her. Did she send any word to her old father, or say when she was coming
back?”
</section>
<section id="48">
Ethan Brand’s eye quailed beneath the old man’s. That daughter, from whom he so earnestly
desired a word of greeting, was the Esther of our tale, the very girl whom, with such cold and
remorseless purpose, Ethan Brand had made the subject of a psychological experiment, and
wasted, absorbed, and perhaps annihilated her soul, in the process.
</section>
<section id="49">
“Yes,” murmured he, turning away from the hoary wanderer, “it is no delusion. There is an
Unpardonable Sin!”
</section>
<section id="40">
While these things were passing, a merry scene was going forward in the area of cheerful light,
beside the spring and before the door of the hut. A number of the youth of the village, young men
and girls, had hurried up the hillside, impelled by curiosity to see Ethan Brand, the hero of so
many a legend familiar to their childhood. Finding nothing, however, very remarkable in his
aspect,—nothing but a sun-burnt wayfarer, in plain garb and dusty shoes, who sat looking into the
fire as if he fancied pictures among the coals,—these young people speedily grew tired of observing
him. As it happened, there was other amusement at hand. An old German Jew travelling with a
diorama on his back, was passing down the [129] mountain road towards the village just as the
party turned aside from it, and, in hopes of eking out the profits of the day, the showman had kept
them company to the lime-kiln.
