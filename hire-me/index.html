              <h1>What is a static website?</h1>
              <p>A static website is the simplest and cheapest way to go about creating and maintaining a website.</p>
              <p>Static websites consist of no backend code (code that is executed on a server that the user doesn't have access to)</p>
              <h3>Pros:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Extremely simple</li>
                <li>Easy to create</li>
                <li>Easy to mantain</li>
                <li>Low operation and creation costs</li>
                <li>Few security risks</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Cons:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>No online payments</li>
                <li>No forums</li>
                <li>Basic form handling</li>
              </ul>
              <p>My base price for a static website is $50, with ~$10 monthly operational costs</p>
            </div>
            <div class="desc-b desc">
              <h1>What is a dynamic website</h1>
              <p>A dynamic website is the most professional way to create a website, but it will be much more expensive.</p>
              <p>You should be looking into a dynamic website if you seek to create a unique experience for your customers, accept online payments, or create a login system or forum</p>
              <h3>Pros:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Futureproofing: with a dynamic start, it will be easier to grow</li>
                <li>Expanded capabilities like forums, online ordering/payment, or account systems</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Cons:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Will likely become complex very quickly</li>
                <li>Much more expensive to create and operate</li>
                <li>More security risks and vulnerabilities</li>
              </ul>
              <p>My base price for a dynamic website is $500, with ~$50 monthly operational costs</p>

              <h1>What is classified as a small website?</h1>
              <p>A small website consists of less than 10 pages.</p>
              <p>Website size is not a commitment; your website can start small and grow as you need it to grow</p>
            </div>

              <h1>What is classified as a large website?</h1>

              <h1>What is a template?</h1>
              <p>I create my own templates that I use for clients who want them. I will make sure that the template does not look or feel like a template. It will be fully populated with your images, logos, and text</p>
              <h3>Pros:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Keeps costs down</li>
                <li>Keeps maintnance simple</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Cons:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>It is not custom, thus it may be a struggle to get it to fit your needs</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I strongly recommend templates. I offer many templates, so we can work to be sure one fits your needs. Templating does not add any cost to you estimate.</p>

              <h1>What is a template?</h1>
              <p>Going custom is a great way to set yourself apart. I will work with you on the design and development of your site to make sure it fits your dreams</p>
              <h3>Pros:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>100% creative freedom</li>

              <h3>Cons:</h3>

                <li>Is very expensive, and will yield slower turnaround times.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Should you decide to go custom, expect to be paying $10-$100 per page.</p>
